# achBldr


achBldr is a NodeJS library for creating and manipulating ACH files (NACHA format).

This project is just getting started, but hopefully it will be production ready in a couple months (end Q2'19).

Planned features:

* Creation of ACH files in NACHA format (PPD, CCD, CTX to start) using high-level API (started)
* Ability to add addenda info consistent to entries (started)
* Parsing of ACH files into JSON (not started)
* Validation of existing ACH files and JSON fields (not started)
